This privacy policy concerns [Weird Fortunes chat bot] ( https://www.facebook.com/WeirdFortunes/ ) .
It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our bot.

### Chatbot Visitors

Any text entered or data transmitted to the Weird Fortunes bot passes through Facebook systems and then to our systems. When it reaches us, there is no non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, or referring site.
The date and time of each message is sent as well as the text or data within the message. We do not collect this information.

The text you enter is maintained within Facebook's administrative interface for the bot. We will never share this information with anyone. We will review it to better understand user behaviour and thus improve the bot.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

We do not request nor collect any personally identifiable information. However, please avoid sharing any information that you would prefer remained private.

We do not disclose personally-identifying information. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

We do not keep any information about our users and do not have aggregate statistics.

### Information We Collect from Other Sources

We do not collect information about you from other sources, incuding Facebook.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Technically, since we do not store any information, it would be hard to provide any information to anyone.

However, We would disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ourselves, third parties or the public at large.

We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

We do not use cookies.

### Business Transfers

Since we do not collect any user information, we could not transfer it if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that could not be transferred or acquired by a third party. 

### Ads

We do not serve ads.

### Comments

Comments and other content submitted to our chat bot are not saved on our servers.
